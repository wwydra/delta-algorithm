<h1>Delta Algorithm Implementation</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This repository contains an implementation of the Delta Algorithm in Java, applied to the Iris dataset. The project demonstrates how to process and analyze data using delta encoding techniques.</p>
<p>Delta encoding is a method of storing or transmitting data in the form of differences between sequential data rather than complete files. This approach is beneficial for efficiently managing data where changes between consecutive data points are minimal. In this project, the Delta Algorithm is applied to the Iris dataset, a well-known dataset in machine learning that includes measurements of iris flowers from three different species.</p>
